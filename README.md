this is a fork of <https://github.com/graphql/graphiql> with the following fixes:

- ExecuteButton button now says "Send a Raven"
- got rid of `precommit` and `prepublish`


this is deployed on NPM <https://www.npmjs.com/package/swyx-graphiql> and you can `npm install swyx-graphiql`

### NOTES TO SELF

build first before releaseing!!!


don't use unless you know what you are doing... yell at @swyx on twitter for help
